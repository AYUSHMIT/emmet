# Emmet

> Be a master builder of databases of material properties. Avoid the Kragle.

The purpose of Emmet is to 'build' collections of materials properties from the output of computational materials calculations. Currently, the effective purpose of Emmet is to take the output of [VASP](http://vasp.at) electronic structure calculations to build MongoDB collections that back the [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org) website and its apps.

Emmet uses [Maggma](https://github.com/materialsproject/maggma), our more general aggregation framework which abstracts away the behind-the-scenes machinery: Maggma provides our `Builder` class and a general interface to Stores, which can be MongoDB collections or plain JSON files.

The `Builder` takes `source` Store(s), processes items in that store, and then builds results to `target` Store(s). 

To ease debugging, in Emmet data flows in *one direction* only: this means that each Store is only built by a specific builder, and will not then be modified by successive builders.

Builders are designed to be run periodically and automatically: as such, Stores have a 'last updated' filter (`lu_filter`) so that we only attempt to process new entries in the Store.

Emmet is currently primarily an internal Materials Project tool so if you're reading this you might have just joined the group, in which case: welcome! :-)

## Installation

Emmet is on PyPI, so `pip install emmet` should work. However, it is currently in very active development, so cloning the git repo and `python setup.py develop` is recommended for now.

###Â Overview

![Overview Flowchart: Vasp Output Directory leads to Tasks Store (via VaspDrone, atomate.vasp.drones), Tasks Store with Materials Setting Store and StructureNLs Store leads to Materials Store (via MaterialsBuilder, emmet.vasp.builders.materials), Materials Store leads to Thermo Store (via ThermoBuilder, emmet.vasp.builders.thermo), Materials Store leads to Elastic Store (via ElasticBuidler, emmet.vasp.builders.elastic), Materials Store leads to Diffraction Store (via DiffractionBuilder, emmet.vasp.builders.diffraction), Materials Store leads to Dielectric Store (via DielectricStore, emmet.vasp.builders.dielectric)](docs/images/EmmetBuilders.png)

### MaterialsBuilder

**Source(s)** `tasks` (typically `tasks` collection), `material_settings` (typically `mat.json`), `snls` (optional)

**Target(s)** `materials` (typically `materials` collection)

##### What MaterialsBuilder does:

1. Filters to only include tasks that completed successfuly.

2. Groups tasks into those for the same structure.

	Structure matching first only selects materials that have the same chemical formula, and then uses pymatgen's `StructureMatcher` to perform symmetry analysis.
	
3. For each property, ranks tasks for a given structure according to those that are expected to predict the property more accurately (for example, a band gap from a band structure calculation is ranked higher than a band gap from a generic calculation). This value is then picked as the canonical value for that property.

	The `task_type` is already determined and comes from the tasks store, and the rankings are specified in `mat.json`. No attempt is made to rank which task of the same `task_type` is best; in this case it is assumed that the most recent calculation takes precendence.
	
4. *(Optional)* StructureNLs (or 'SNLs') are a way to bundle a structure and its metadata (such as bibtex references for where the structure came from) within the Materials Project. This will lookup if there are existing SNL(s) for the structure, and assign an SNL accordingly.


##### Sample MaterialsBuilder output:

Property | Key Path | Example | Validation | Comment
-------- | -------- | ------- | ---------- | -------
Anonymous formula | `anonymous_formula` | | str, required | 
Band gap / eV | `bandstructure.band_gap` | | float, > 0, required | Always from GGA calculation
Conduction band minimum / eV  | `bandstructure.cbm` | | float, optional |
etc. (to add) |

### ThermoBuilder

**Source(s)** `materials`

**Target(s)** `thermo`

##### What ThermoBuilder does:

1. Groups materials into those in the same chemical system (that is, structures which contain the same elements).

	Here, 'material' means an item from the `materials` Store and its corresponding crystallagraphic structure.
2. Filters out materials that can not be directly compared to each other, e.g. they've been calculated by different methods such that their total energies are on different scales.

	By default, this is done by using `MaterialsProjectCompatibility('Advanced')` in pymatgen, which intelligently mixes GGA and GGA+U calculations depending on the elements present, and performs corrections to the total energy as appropriate.
	
3. Uses pymatgen's `phasediagram` module to calculate [energy above hull](https://materialsproject.org/wiki/index.php/Glossary_of_Terms#Energetics) for each material and, if the material is unstable, its decomposition pathway.
